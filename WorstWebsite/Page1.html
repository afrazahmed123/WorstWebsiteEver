    <h4>
        Hindi cinema, often known as Bollywood and formerly as Bombay cinema,[6]
        is the Indian Hindi-language film industry based in
        Mumbai (formerly Bombay). The term is a portmanteau of "Bombay" and "Hollywood".
        The industry is related to Cinema of South India and other Indian film industries,
        making up Indian Cinemaâ€”the world's largest by number of feature films produced.[3][7][8]
        Indian cinema has an annual output of 1,986 feature films in 2017.
        Bollywood is its largest film producer, with 364 Hindi films produced in 2017.[3]
        Bollywood represents 43 percent of Indian net box-office revenue;
        Tamil and Telugu cinema represent 36 percent, and
        the remaining regional cinema constituted 21 percent in 2014.[4]
        Bollywood is one of the largest centres of film production in the world.[9][10][11]
        In 2001 ticket sales, Indian cinema (including Bollywood)
        reportedly sold an estimated 3.6 billion tickets worldwide, compared to Hollywood's
        2.6 billion tickets sold.[12][13][14]
        Bollywood films tend to use vernacular Hindustani,
        mutually intelligible by people who self-identify as speaking either Hindi or Urdu,[15][16][17]
        and modern Bollywood movies[18] increasingly incorporate elements of Hinglish.[15]
