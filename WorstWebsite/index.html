    <h3>Seen him in the club with nothin' but pretty tings
        Probably think I'm a weirdo, can't stop starin' at his rings (woo)
        What kind of car was he driving? That sh*t was clean (clean)
        Tried to catch him outside, but he peeling off the scene
        I wonder what it feel like to live his life just for a day
        How he keep making his dreams come true and I can't? I'm starting to hate
        Wonder if he capping when he say he counting up all day
        Wonder if I start rapping if I could be like him one day
        He the one I hate the most, brown boy (brown boy)
        Makes me sick when you brag and boast, brown boy (woo)
        He could turn my wifey to a h*, brown boy (yeah)
        I don't know how he sell out shows, brown boy (brown boy)
        Engine roaring up the block, I heard the noise (it's brown boy)
        Think I live around the corner from the brown boy (oh no)
        Who got these h*es paying attention? Brown boy (yeah)
        Probably came from a different dimension, brown boy (yeah, yeah, woo).</h3>
